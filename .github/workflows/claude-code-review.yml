    REPO: ${{ github.repository }}
    PR NUMBER: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
    TITLE: ${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}
    BODY: ${{ github.event.pull_request.body }}
    AUTHOR: ${{ github.event.pull_request.user.login }}
    COMMIT: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}
    Note: The PR branch is already checked out in the current working directory.

    Gather Context (complete these steps FIRST, silently - don't report on this process):
    1. Check CI status: Use mcp__github_ci__get_ci_status to see if tests passed/failed
    2. Get previous reviews: Run gh pr view ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --comments
    3. Identify previous bot reviews and track which issues were raised before
    4. If CI failed: Use mcp__github_ci__get_workflow_run_details for failure details

    Review Approach:
    - If first review: Comprehensive analysis of all changes
    - If previous reviews exist: Focus on changes since last review, track issue status, understand how changes impact pr
    - Incorporate CI/test failure context into your feedback if relevant
    - Use inline comments (mcp__github_inline_comment__create_inline_comment) for specific code issues

    Do not include in your review:
    - Task completion statements ("I completed the review", "Review finished")
    - Process descriptions ("First I checked X, then I analyzed Y")
    - Generic meta-commentary about reviewing
    - Progress tracking

    Review this pull request by individually analysing each of these thoroughly:
    - Code quality and best practices
    - Potential bugs or issues
    - Security implications
    - Performance considerations
    - Test coverage
    - assistant-ui specific requirements:
      - The PR has a changeset if updating source code of published packages (packages/*)
      - The PR includes documentation if API surface changes

    Provide a comprehensive review build on previous reviews including:
    - Summary of changes since last review
    - Critical issues found (be thorough)
    - Suggested improvements (be thorough)
    - Good practices observed (be concise - list only the most notable items without elaboration)
    - Leverage collapsible <details> sections where appropriate for lengthy explanations or code snippets to enhance human readability

    When reviewing subsequent commits:
    - Track status of previously identified issues
    - Identify new problems introduced since last review
    - Note if fixes introduced new issues

    IMPORTANT: Be comprehensive about issues and improvements. For good practices, be brief - just note what was done well without explaining why or praising excessively. NO meta-commentary about the review process itself.

    Use `mcp__github_inline_comment__create_inline_comment` to comment on specific code lines.
    You have been provided with the mcp__github_comment__update_claude_comment tool to update your comment. This tool automatically handles PR comments. Only the body parameter is required - the tool automatically knows which comment to update.

    IMPORTANT: Submit your review feedback by updating the Claude comment using mcp__github_comment__update_claude_comment. This will be displayed as your PR review.
